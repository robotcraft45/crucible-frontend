          There is no “dev team”. There is no company. There is only a community
          of alchemists figuring out what to build in the open.

          Becoming an alchemist requires learning and practice. Training is a
          way of life for a true alchemist. There is no final destination, only
          continuous change.

          ⚗️ is used to coordinate and reward committed alchemists. Whether you
          are an artist, a developer, a community manager, or a liquidity
          provider, there is a role for you.
